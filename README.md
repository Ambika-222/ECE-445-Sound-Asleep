# ECE-445-Sound-Asleep

Description - Sound Asleep aims to introduce a comfortable, wireless, and real-time system designed to both detect and enhance slow-wave sleep. Our device consists of a lightweight EEG headband that records brain activity and transmits it via Bluetooth to a smartphone application. The mobile app analyzes EEG signals in real-time to detect SWS and delivers auditory stimuli i.e. pink noise bursts through the user’s chosen audio device at precise moments in the sleep cycle. Unlike traditional wearables, Sound Asleep prioritizes comfort and accessibility by allowing users to use their own headphones or speakers. By integrating closed-loop stimulation into a user-friendly system, this project bridges the gap between academic research and practical, consumer-ready sleep enhancement.
